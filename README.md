# **Ultimate Hangman**

## **Overview**

This hangman game is based on the original hangman game but with extra features: leaderboards, difficulty modes and word definition tokens. This game is based inside a mock terminal deployed via Heroku.

The game's challenging nature alongside with the leaderboard system creates a competitive environment with players, each trying to get a higher score and represent their Country/City.
