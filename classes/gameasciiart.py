|    1 - You will have 7 attempts to guess the right word      |
|    by guessing the word outright or guessing with letters.   |
|    2 - If you guess wrong, hangman will start to build       | 
|    and if you have more than 15 points, they will be         |
|    deducted by 10 each time.                                 |
|    3 - If the attempts reach 0, hangman will be killed       |
|    and you will lose the game.                               |
|    4 - Each time you play and your attempts reach 3          |
|    you will get a hint token, if you use it you will get     |
|    the definition of the word but also 25 points             |
|    will be deducted if you have more than 25 already.        |

|   + 100 points if you guess the word right with half of      |
|      the word exposed                                        |
|   + 750 points if you guess the word right without           |
|    revealing the first half of the word already              |
|   - 10 points if you guess a letter wrong, only applies if   |
|    your points are more than 15 already.                     |
